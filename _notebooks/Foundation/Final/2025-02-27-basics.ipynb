    "My code makes use of several **Control Structures**, **Data Types**, and **Operators** in JavaScript. Let's walk through the code and see where each concept is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Control Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conditional Statements:**\n",
    "I used **conditional statements** in multiple places, specifically in the `handleLevelEnd` and `checkDefeat` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`if` statement:**\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  if (this.currentLevelIndex >= this.levelClasses.length) {\n",
    "      this.stopTimer();\n",
    "      return;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`else` statement:**\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  else { // All levels completed\n",
    "      alert(\"Game over. All levels completed.\");\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks conditions and executes different blocks of code based on those conditions (whether the game should stop or the level is completed).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`else if` statement:**\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  if (this.currentLevelIndex < this.levelClasses.length - 1) {\n",
    "      alert(\"Level ended.\");\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "      alert(\"Game over. All levels completed.\");\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks if the current level is not the last, and handles the level completion or game completion accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Loops:**\n",
    "- **`for` loop:**\n",
    "  In the `loadLevelObjects` method, I iterate over the objects in the `gameInstance` to instantiate them.\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  for (let object of gameInstance.objects) {\n",
    "      if (!object.data) object.data = {};\n",
    "      new object.class(object.data);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Switch Statement:**\n",
    "Although my code doesn't contain a switch-case directly, it seems like my `loadLevel` function could benefit from it if I have different levels that could be handled separately. For example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "switch(this.currentLevelIndex) {\n",
    "    case 0:\n",
    "        // Handle Level 0\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    case 1:\n",
    "        // Handle Level 1\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        // Handle other levels\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Primitive Data Types:**\n",
    "- **String**: I use strings to display messages, such as `\"Level ended.\"` and `\"Game over. All levels completed.\"`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  alert(\"Level ended.\");\n",
    "  alert(\"Game over. All levels completed.\");\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number**: I use numbers for various things like `this.currentLevelIndex`, `this.levelClasses.length`, and in `this.currentPass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  if (this.currentLevelIndex >= this.levelClasses.length)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boolean**: I also use booleans to control flow, such as `GameEnv.continueLevel` and `GameEnv.timerActive` to indicate whether the game or timer should continue.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  if (GameEnv.continueLevel) { \n",
    "      // do something\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Complex Data Types:**\n",
    "- **Object**: I use objects for `gameInstance.objects`, `LevelClass`, and `GameEnv` game-related information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  this.levelClasses = [GameLevelDesert, GameLevelWater, GameLevelGrassland, GameLevelFight, GameLevelAftermath];\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Array**: I use arrays to store levels (`levelClasses`) and to handle game objects in `gameInstance.objects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  this.levelClasses = [GameLevelDesert, GameLevelWater, GameLevelGrassland, GameLevelFight, GameLevelAftermath];\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Arithmetic Operators:**\n",
    "- **`=` (Assignment)**: I use this operator to assign values to variables like `this.currentLevelIndex`, `this.levelClasses`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  this.currentLevelIndex = 0;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comparison Operators:**\n",
    "- **`>=` (Greater than or equal to)**: Used to check if the player has completed all levels or to compare the current level index.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  if (this.currentLevelIndex >= this.levelClasses.length) {\n",
    "      this.stopTimer();\n",
    "      return;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Logical Operators:**\n",
    "- **`&&` (Logical AND)**: In my `handleLevelEnd` function, I use `&&` to check conditions to determine the level status.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  if (this.currentLevelIndex < this.levelClasses.length - 1) {\n",
    "      alert(\"Level ended.\");\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Ternary Operator:**\n",
    "I did not use the **ternary operator** directly in the code, but it could be used as a shorthand for `if-else` statements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "this.currentLevelIndex < this.levelClasses.length - 1 \n",
    "    ? alert(\"Level ended.\") \n",
    "    : alert(\"Game over. All levels completed.\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Control Structures**: I use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`) and loops (`for`) to manage game flow and level transitions.\n",
    "2. **Data Types**: Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects are used to handle game states, manage player data, and track game progress.\n",
    "3. **Operators**: I use comparison, assignment, and logical operators to control game behavior and flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "My code relies heavily on these concepts to structure the game logic and ensure that the game progresses through levels, handles player actions, and stores necessary data."
